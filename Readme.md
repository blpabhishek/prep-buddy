Data Preparation is the process of gathering, cleaning, and consolidating data into a form suitable for further analysis and processing.
Its estimated that the preparation phase alone accounts for about 60%-80% of the overall time spent in any data mining project.
Data preparation vastly improves the quality of data and consequently helps in improving the quality of results from analytical models.
