Data Preparation is the process of gathering, cleaning, and consolidating data into a form suitable for further analysis and processing. 
Our aim is to build a rich library of data preparation  tasks that makes this activity scalable and easy to execute in Spark and Hadoop environments. 
It consists of common preparation tasks such as de-duplication, different kinds of imputations and other transformations.
