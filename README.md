[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/data-commons/prep-buddy.svg?branch=scala)](https://travis-ci.org/data-commons/prep-buddy)
#### Data Preparation Library for Spark

A Scala / Java / Python library for cleaning, transforming and executing other preparation tasks for large datasets on Apache Spark.

It is currently maintained by a team of developers from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com).

Post questions and comments to the Google group, or email them directly to data-commons-toolchain@googlegroups.com

Docs are available at http://data-commons.github.io/prep-buddy
Or check out the [Javadocs] (http://data-commons.github.io/prep-buddy/javadocs) or Python doc (coming soon!).

Our aim is to provide a set of algorithms for cleaning and transforming very large data sets, 
inspired by predecessors such as Open Refine, Pandas and Scikit-learn packages.
