# Prep Buddy
Data Preparation is the process of gathering, cleaning, and consolidating data into a form suitable for further analysis and processing. 
Our aim is to build a rich data preparation library that makes data preparation scalable and easy to be carried out in the Hadoop environment. 
It consists of common preparation tasks such as De-duplication, different kinds of imputations and transformations, grouping operations etc.
